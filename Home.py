st.write("#### Our model follows a UNet onvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. UNet was originally invented and first used for biomedical image segmentation. Its architecture can be broadly thought of as an encoder network followed by a decoder network.")
st.write("- The encoder is the first half in the architecture diagram. It usually is a pre-trained classification network like VGG/ResNet where you apply convolution blocks followed by a maxpool downsampling to encode the input image into feature representations at multiple different levels.")
st.write(" - The decoder is the second half of the architecture. The goal is to semantically project the discriminative features (lower resolution) learnt by the encoder onto the pixel space (higher resolution) to get a dense classification. The decoder consists of upsampling and concatenation followed by regular convolution operations.")
